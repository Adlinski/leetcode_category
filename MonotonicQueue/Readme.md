Monotonic Queue
===
* **LC84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram**
* **LC239. Sliding Window Maximum**
* **LC907. Sum of Subarray Minimums**, which reduces to the problem of finding the "nearest" element smaller than `A[i]` 
* [Frog Jump II](https://anthony-huang.github.io/competitiveprogramming/2016/06/06/monotonic-queue.html): K steps at most with cost `A[i]` if landing at position `i`
* Any DP problem where `A[i] = min(A[i-d1:i-d2])` where `d1 > d2 >= 1`
