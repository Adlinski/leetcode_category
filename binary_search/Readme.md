## NOTES
1. Some hard problems are actually easy to validate.

Some problems which seem to very tough can actually be validated easily. This includes problems like 
"410. Split Array Largest Sum" : given the largest sum, you can check if spliting the array into k subarrays are possible in O(n) time.

"786. K-th Smallest Prime Fraction": given the smallest prime fraction, you can check if there are K pairs whose prime fraction is smaller than the given value in O(n) time.  

"373. Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums": given the smallest sum, you can check if there are K pairs whose sum is smaller in O(n) time.  

The solutions are actually also monotonic. So BINARY SEARCH is a choice!
