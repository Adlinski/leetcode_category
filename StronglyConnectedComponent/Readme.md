# Strongly Connected Component (SCC)


## To check if every node has both paths to and from every other node in a given graph:

DFS/BFS from all nodes:
---
[Tarjan's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm) supposes every node has a depth `d[i]`. Initially, the root has the smallest depth. And we do the post-order DFS updates `d[i] = min(d[j])` for any neighbor `j` of `i`. Actually BFS also works fine with the reduction rule `d[i] = min(d[j])` here.

    function dfs(i)
        d[i] = i
        mark i as visited
        for each neighbor j of i: 
            if j is not visited then dfs(j)
            d[i] = min(d[i], d[j])

If there is a forwarding path from `u` to `v`, then `d[u] <= d[v]`. In the SCC, `d[v] <= d[u] <= d[v]`, thus, all the nodes in SCC will have the same depth. To tell if a graph is a SCC, we check whether all nodes have the same `d[i]`.

Two DFS/BFS from the single node:
---
It is a simplified version of the [Kosarajuâ€™s algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strongly-connected-components/). Starting from the root, we check if every node can be reached by DFS/BFS. Then, reverse the direction of every edge. We check if every node can be reached from the same root again. See [C++ code](http://codeforces.com/contest/475/submission/8140615).

## Find SCC

The most useful and fast-coding algorithm for finding SCCs is Kosaraju.

1. DFS on the graph and sort the vertices in decreasing of their finishing time (we can use a stack `L`).
2. Reverse the graph edges
2. Start from the vertex with the greatest finishing time, and for each vertex v that is not yet in any SCC, do : 
3. for each u that v is reachable by u and u is not yet in any SCC, put it in the SCC of vertex v.

Suppose the list `L` is the post-order DFS visit of nodes. `u->v` indicates that there exists a forwarding path from `u` to `v`.

If `u->v` and not `v->u`, then `u` must appear at the **left** of `v` in `L`. The nodes in a SCC, such as `v` and `w`, however, may appear in any arbitrary order on the list `L`.

So, if a node `x` appear strictly before `y` on the list `L`:

* case1: `x->y` and `y->x`, like the case of `v` and `w`
* case2: `x->y` and not `y->x`, like the case of `u` and `v`
* case3: not `x->y` and not `y->x`

Among the nodes which can reach `y`, we need to eliminate the nodes which `y` can NOT reach. To achieve this goal, we iterate through `L` from left to right and run DFS starting from each node on the transpose graph. If some node is reached by DFS and does not belong to any SCC, then we add this node to the SCC of current root.

For case 1 & 2, `x` is already in some SCC, so when the second DFS from `y` reach `x`, nothing happens. Besides, `y` is already added to the SCC of `x` in case 1. For case 3, in the transpose graph, DFS from `y` would not reach `x`.

In short, the first DFS arranges those nodes which **can** reach `v` but **can not** be reached from `v` on its **left**. So the second DFS is able to skip such nodes.

Implemtation tricks:

The first and second DFS can share the same `visited` array. The dfs1 starts with all-false `visited` and set the visited nodes as `true`. And dfs2 starts with the all-true `visited` and set the visited nodes as `false`.
