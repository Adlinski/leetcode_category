## Notes 
1. Identify the style suits your problem better
```
  array.sort()
  l, r = 0, len(array) # NOTE never try array[r] in this case
  while l < r:
    mid = (l + r) // 2
    if array[mid] >= target: # NOTE when not target found,
                             # equal make sure search ending up with an element GREATER than target.
      r = mid
    else:
      l = mid + 1
  # NOW, l=r and array[r]==target
  return l
```

The first style solves most problems, while there is also another style.
```
  array.sort()
  l, r = 0, len(array) - 1 
  while l <= r:
    mid = (l + r) // 2

    if array[mid]==target:
      return mid # return when found target

    # NOTE you can access array[r] in this case, useful for problem like "min element in rotated array"

    if array[mid] > target:
      r = mid - 1
    else:
      l += mid + 1 

  # NOW, l=r+1 and target is not found
  return l
```

2. Binary search is a universal treatment for monotonic functions. 
The trick is to identify the monotonic natural of certain searching problems. 

Examples include Leetcode problems like:

* "Minimize Max Distance to Gas Station"
* "Find K-th Smallest Pair Distance"
* "K-th Smallest Prime Fraction"
